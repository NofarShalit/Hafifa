Kerberos
1) When a client wants to authenticate with kerberos:
    1. Client requests an authentication ticket (TGT) from the key distribution center (KDC)
    2. The KDC verifies the credentials and sends back an encrypted TGT and session key
    3. The TGT is encrypted using the ticket granting service (TGS) secret key
    4. The client stores the TGT and when it expires the local session manager will request another TGT
    5. The client sends the TGT to the current TGS with the service principal name (SPN) of the
    resource the client wants to access
    6. the KDC verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service he is trying to reach
    7. TGS sends a valid session key to the client
    8. Client forwards the session key to the service to prove he has access to the resourc and the
    service grants hem the access

2) A KDC or Key Distribution Center, is the main server which is consulted before communication takes place,
    the KDC allows two systems to establish a secure connection to transfer data, with a uniquely generated key
    to encrypt the data, the KDC is used instead of a standard key to minimize the chances of attack, by generating
    new keys each time, due to its central architecture a KDC is used in smaller network to not overwhelm the network
