Kerberos
1) When a client wants to authenticate with kerberos:
    1. Client requests an authentication ticket (TGT) from the key distribution center (KDC)
    2. The KDC verifies the credentials and sends back an encrypted TGT and session key
    3. The TGT is encrypted using the ticket granting service (TGS) secret key
    4. The client stores the TGT and when it expires the local session manager will request another TGT
    5. The client sends the TGT to the current TGS with the service principal name (SPN) of the
    resource the client wants to access
    6. the KDC verifies the TGT of the user and that the user has access to the service he is trying to reach
    7. TGS sends a valid session key to the client
    8. Client forwards the session key to the service to prove he has access to the resourc and the
    service grants hem the access

2) A KDC or Key Distribution Center, is a process in a domain that proveides two services:
    1. Authentication Service (AS): This service issues TGTs to the TGS in its own domain or any other
    trusted domain, before a client can ask for a ticket for another computer if must request a TGT from the AS
    the AS returns a TGT for the TGS, the TGT can be reused until it expires but before accessing any domain TGS,
    the client has to access its own domain TGS
    2. Ticket Granting Service (TGS): the service grants tickets to access computers in the domain, before a client
    can access a computer they contact the TGS in the target computers domain and give them their TGT, and ask for a TGT
    The KDC for a domain is located on the domain controller, both services start automaticaly by the DC's
    Local Security Authority LSA, if the KDC is unavailable the AD is also unavailable and the domain controller is
    not controlling the domain, to mitigate this AD networks have more than one Domain Controllers
    The SPN used by the KDC is "krbtgt"
