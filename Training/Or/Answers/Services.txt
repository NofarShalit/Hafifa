Services
1) Windows Services are applications that are installed as a service, meaning they don't need user interaction,
    can start without user interaction and continue to run after the user thas logged off, services are usualy
    started when the machine is booted, they manage a wide variety of functions like sound, backups, network connecitons,
    display color, etc, similarly to UNIX daemons.
    The Windows Services Control Manager can control all aspects of a service, it can choose the method of start mechanism,
    show us all properties of a service like name, description, status and type. there are 3 categories of services:
    Local Services, Network Services and System. Developers who choose to install their software as services can create new services.

2) The Service Host (svchost.exe) is a shared service proccess that serves as a shell to laod services from DLLs.
    Services are organized into related host groups and each service runs in a difference of svchost, so problems
    in one instance won't affect others. systems with more than 3.5GB of RAM will automaticaly seperated each service
    into its own svchost proccess. The security challenges with svchost is that it is very easy for attackers to hide 
    their malware in svchost but its very difficult for us to differentiate beetween legitimate svchost and malicious ones.

3) A Service malware can use the startup functionallity of the services Manager, and tell the system to turn the malicious service
    to automaticaly start with the computer booting up, and so get persistency.
