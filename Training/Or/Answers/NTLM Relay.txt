NTLM Relay
1) NTLM Relay attack allows attackers to steal hashed versions of users passwords and relay them
    in order to authenticate to servers, attackers use Machine-In-The-Middle technique in order
    to intercet the client requests. to initiate the attack the certificate servers should
    not be configured with protections, NTLM authentication needs to be enabled on the domain,
    and the AD certificate servers should be used with "Certificate Authority Web Enrollment" or
    "Certificate Enrollment Web Service"

2) NetBIOS and LLMNR spoofing can be done in order to get a victim computer to access an attacker
    controlled machine, and when the victim computer tries to authenticate, the authentication can
    be relayed with NTLM Relay and sniffed on to get the password hashes and crack them later,
    basically what happens in that LLMNR and NetBIOS spoofing can be done to get a victim to think
    that an attacker controlled machine is the legitimate destination and let the attacker relay the
    data and sniff it

4) Currently today it is much harder to perform NTLM Relay attacks for a few reasons:
    - Kerberos is much more used to additional waiting needs to happen before a client uses NTLM
    - Patches exists for CVE-2021-36942
    - We can disable NTLM on domain controllers, IIS and AD CS
    - We can enable EPA and disable HTTP on AD CS
    And in general NTLM is a legacy protocol so it is less used now
