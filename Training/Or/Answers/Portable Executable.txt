Portable Executable
1) DLL is a Dynamic Link Library, meaning it is a library of functions that can be imported by any PE file in order to either,
  have ready to use functions and not create yourself each and everyone of them, or either to have control over api, software, other files, etc.
  the use of DLL's is for storing functions and importing them like librarys in code. The biggest user of DLL's is the OS with it's apis,
  but every developer who wants to communicate with other software or with the OS can include DLL's in its code in order to get api access to whatever he wants.
  DLL's are "linked" to the file and therefore don't take space in the file, the file just points to them and they are saved somewhere else,
  they can also be included in the file so it will be portable and independant, but people tend to use LIB files for that which are just DLL's but non dynamic.
