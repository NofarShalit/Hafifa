Active Directory
1) LAPS or Local Administrator Password Solution is a system to automaticaly manage local_admin passwords across the domain,
    the system generates random unique passwords for each computer and saved the passwords in active directory,
    the password is saved inside a special attribute in the adctive directory computer object for each corresponding computer,
    this system lets domain admins select which users has read permissions on the local admin passwords,
    LAPS uses group policy client-side-extention that is installed on each managed computer to perform all managment tasks.
    LAPS checks for each computer if the password has expired or required to be changed, and if so, LAPS changes the password
    according to the password policy and, saved it in active directory

2) The AdminSDHolder is a special container in active directory, the ACL of AdminSDHolder is used as a template to copy
    permissions to all protected groups, active directory takes the ACL of AdminSDHolder and applies it to all protected
    users and groups, and so if an attacker takes control on the AdminSDHolder he can manipulate the permissions on it
    and they will be copied automaticaly, so this way an attacker can have persistent access to priveledged accounts in
    the domain. The AdminSDHolder is pushed every 60 minutes by default with the SDProp process, but the timing can be changed

3) Group Policy Objects or GPOs are a representation of a file system settings for local or doamin settings for domain GPOs,
    all GPOs are devided to two parts: computer settings and user settings, the computer settings will override user settings,
    we can use GPOs to enforce strict login rules for users, to prevent high priveledge usaers from connecting to unsupervised
    computers, we can prevent cmd from working in everycomputer and so to prevent from attackers from running commands from infected
    systems. we can use GPOs for monitoring and response because they let us audit changes in the computer or in users, and let us
    create events for event log appropriatly to monitor

4) When Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled, windows secrets that are suppose to be saved in the Local Security Authority
    (LSA) are saved in a virtualized isolated LSA, when used the isolated LSA doesn't load drivers, but only a small number binaries
    that are needed. when windows credential guard is enabled, kerberos doesn't allow for unconstrained delegation.
    Control Flow Guard is a feature that was created to combat memory corruption vulnerabilities, by restricting where applications
    can execute code from, CFG can prevent memory corruption and restrict server capabilities in order to reduce attack surface,
    and make it harder to exploit buffer overflow

5) Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or LDAP, is a protocol that acts like a language for quering information inside a domain,
    similarly to sql but for doamin queries, LDAP specifies a method of directory storage and facilitates the authentication and
    authorization of users to files and servers, by default LDAP is unsecure, and to secure it we can use LDAP over SLL or TLS by
    installing a properly formatted certificate on the domain controller from a CA.
