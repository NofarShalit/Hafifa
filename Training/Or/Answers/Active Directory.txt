Active Directory
1) LAPS or Local Administrator Password Solution is a system to automaticaly manage local_admin passwords across the domain,
    the system generates random unique passwords for each computer and saved the passwords in active directory,
    the password is saved inside a special attribute in the adctive directory computer object for each corresponding computer,
    this system lets domain admins select which users has read permissions on the local admin passwords,
    LAPS uses group policy client-side-extention that is installed on each managed computer to perform all managment tasks.
    LAPS checks for each computer if the password has expired or required to be changed, and if so, LAPS changes the password
    according to the password policy and, saved it in active directory

2) The AdminSDHolder is a special container in active directory, the ACL of AdminSDHolder is used as a template to copy
    permissions to all protected groups, active directory takes the ACL of AdminSDHolder and applies it to all protected
    users and groups, and so if an attacker takes control on the AdminSDHolder he can manipulate the permissions on it
    and they will be copied automaticaly, so this way an attacker can have persistent access to priveledged accounts in
    the domain. The AdminSDHolder is pushed every 60 minutes by default with the SDProp process, but the timing can be changed
