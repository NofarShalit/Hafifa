Pass The Ticket
1) Instead of forging tickets like in Golden Ticket attack, in Pass The Ticket we steal valid tickets
    that has already been forged and pass them from one system to another in order to access resources
    as a legitimate user.
    An attacker can dump the LSASS process and steal all cached TGTs and TGS tickets from a system.
    Both the TGTs and TGS tickets can be stolen and reused to authenticate to other network computers
    and they usally last for up to 10 hours, sessions are isolated within Active Directory in order to
    prevent other sessions form accessing any data, if an attacker is able to escalate priviledges to
    Administrator or SYSTEM, they can reach into other sessions and extract valid tickets from other users.

2) We can use mimikatz and Rebeus to initiate a Pass The Hash attack
    And to recognize a Pass The Ticket attack we can look at event viewer, using EventID 4624 with logon type 3
    and Authentication Package of NTLM, and correlating the logon id frpm EventID 4624 with the logon id in EventID 4672
    can let us locate a Pass The Tickte attack
