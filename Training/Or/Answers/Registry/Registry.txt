5) AppInit_DLLs is a mechanism that allows a list of DLLs to be loaded into each user mode process,
    The linux "LD_PRELOAD" equivalent for windows. Whenever a process runs in the system in user mode,
    all the DLLs in AppInit_DLLs are loaded to that process too, this can be used maliciously for DLL Injeciton.
    AppInit_DLLs are used to hook to APIs and can be used to replace legitimate functions with malicious
    ones. If the target computer have UEFI support it can check for secure boot support, and if secure boot
    is enabled the AppInit_DLLs feature is disabled. From windows 8 onwards, if an app wants a certificate,
    it must not load arbitrary DLLs that will intercept with win32apis using the AppInit_DLLs mechanism.
