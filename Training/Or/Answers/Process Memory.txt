Process Memory
1) When a process tries to access an object it creates a handle to it

2) a.
    b. A memory mapped file is a file loaded into virtual memory, this mapping between a file and memory
        lets processes write and read to and from files inside the memory
        There are two types of memory mapped files:
        - Persisted Memory Mapped files:
        Persisted files are memory mapped files that are linked to a source from the disk, and so when
        working on a file, all changes are saved to the source file in the disk.
        This files ar best for large source files
        - Non-Persisted Memory Mapped files:
        Non persisted files are memory mapped files that are not linked to a source, so when a process
        has finished working with them, the data is lost and the file is reclaimed by the garbage collector
        This files are best for IPC communications
        Memory mapped files are accessed through the operating systems memory manager, so the files are
        automaticaly partitioned into a number of pages and accessed as needed
    c. A Thread Stack is used to store the location of the return address. When a stack is used, the return address
        is saved so that the data can be restored from the stack. the return address provided bt the caller is stored
        in the thread stack
    d. A heap is an area of pre-allcoated memory, that a program can access to store data.
        The variable amount of the heap isn't known until the program is run.
        A proccess will always have at least one heap, but it can have more. applictions should always call
        heap functions on its default proccess heap or on its private heaps.
