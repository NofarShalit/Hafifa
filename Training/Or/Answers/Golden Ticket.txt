Golden Ticket
1) In Active Directory, when accounts sign in they get a kerberos ticket that contains their authentication token
    The Golden Ticket is the kerberos authentication token for the krbtgt account which is a special account that
    that is used to encrypt all the authentication tokens in active directory with its password hash.
    The Golden Ticket can be used with a pass-the-hash technique to log into any account, allowing attackers to move
    inside a network unnoticed, everything a Domain Admin can do, an attacker can do with a Golden Ticket
    In roder to create and use a Golden Ticket:
    1. We need to get inside the network, via phishing or other vulnerabilities
    2. We need to get an account with access to the domain controllers
    3. Log into the DC and dump the password hash for the krbtgt account to create the golden ticket,
        we can use mimikatz for that
    4. Finnaly, we need to load out kerberos token into any session for any user and we can access everything,
        we can use mimikatz for that
    The victims can change the krbtgt password or even rebuild the DC and the token we haveis still gonna be valid
    Getting a Golden Ticket requires having domain admin level rights so if the attacker already has that,
    a Golden Ticket will be just a tool for him to play with rather than the way to control the AD

2) Five tools can be used to forge a Golden Ticket: Mimikatz, Impacket, Rubeus.exe, Metasploit and Empire.
    Sometimes when using a golden ticket, attackers will specify fake or blank account name and domain name since those
    parameters don't need to be valid, so we can use EventID 4769 to find service tickets for users or domains that
    doesn't exist in the enviroment and know somebody used a Golden Ticket, more so if a TGS rewuest was made without a
    corresponding TGT request than the TGS is probably using a Golden Ticket to forge the request
