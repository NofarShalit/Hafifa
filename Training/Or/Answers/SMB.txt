SMB
1)
The SMB message is built from 3 parts:
1. The Header - the smb header contain a few part:
  Protocol - this section contains 4 bytes and will always be " '\xFF','S','M','B' " in this order
  Command - a 1 byte command code
  Status - a 4 byte field for the server to communicate the errors to the client
  Flags - a 8 bit field for 8 1-bit flags that describe features affecting the message
  Flags2 - a 16 bit field for 16 1-bit flags that describe features affecting the message, unspecified bits are reserved and must be zero
  PIDHigh - a 2 byte field that if set to non zero represent the high-order bytes of a PID, combine with PIDLow to get full PID
  SecurityFeatures - this field has 3 possible interpretation:
    If security signatures are negotiated there is an 8 1-byte field for this.
    If SMB signing is negotiated this field contains a 8 byte cryptographic message signature that help to check if the data has been modified in transit
    If CIFS is being transported than the field will be structured with " Key, CID, SequenceNumber "
      Key - a 4 byte field with an encryption key used for contactless transport
      CID - a 2 byte field with connection identifier
      SequenceNumber - a 2 byte field with numbers to identify the sequence of message over contactless transport
    If no case applies this field is reserved and set to zero
  Reserved - a reserved 2 byte field that should be set to zero
  TID - a 2 byte tree identifier
  PIDLow - the lower 16 bit of the pid
  UID - a 2 byte field with user identifier information
  MID - a 2 byte field with multiplex identifier
2. Parameter Block - the parameter block contains 2 parts:
  WordCount - a 1 byte field containing the size of the Word array, this field can be zero if the words field is empty
  Words - the parameter structure of the message, the size of this field must be 2*WordCount in bytes
3. Data Block - similar structur to the parameter block
  ByteCount - a filed of 2 bytes containing the size of the Bytes array, this field can be zero indicating that the Bytes field is empty
  Bytes - the data structure of the message, this field must be the size of ByteCount in bytes, if BytesCount is zero this field is ignored

2) An SMB Relay attack is when an attacker intercepts the NTLMv2 communication between a client and a server,
  the attacker lets the victim go through the normal authentication process and intercepts when the server sends the
  final authentication packet to let the victim know it has succsesfully authenticated, the attacker takes the packet
  for himself and can now communicate with the server, meanwhile the attacker tells the victim it has succsesfully authenticated,
  and relays all of his traffic through him to the server, and vice versa, and so he can see all communications beetween 
  the victim and attacker.
  TL:DR - MiTM attack of NTLMv2 Protocol

3) Relay to SMB - this attack is when a victim is being manipulated in one way or another to click, open, etc a file or web server,
  and gets redirected to a malicious SMB server and automatically authenticates to the server and sends it credentials to it.
