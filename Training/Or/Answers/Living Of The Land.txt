Living Of The Land

A Living Of The Land or (LotL) attack is when an attacker uses legitimate software found on the infected
system to perform malicious acts on it. In LotL, an attacker will forge whatever software is found on the
computer to achieve its goals, whether it would be SSH for backdoor, or WMI for extracting information.
LotL attacks are classified as fileless because they do not leave any trace behind, A lot of LotL attacks
use software found on any computer instead of bringing their own like Powershell, WMI, NETSH, Sysinternals,
SC tools, or even forensic tools like mimikatz if found. Attacker do not leave files so there are no
signatures to detect, the use of legitimate tools can complicate the investigation, and legitimate
tools may appear on the allow list in a computer so no anomalous activity will be present.
To detect and counter LotL attacks we can use solutions based on behavioral analysis, the technology
detect anomalous program and user activity so to find actions that could signify an attack.
