NTFS

    - fast read and write speeds
    - can manage permissions
    - low compatibillity with different OS's
    - max volume size of 16EB

    FAT32:
    - can't store files larger than 4GB
    - slow read and write speeds
    - doesn't have permissions
    - compatible with lots of OS's
    - max volume size of 8TB

2) DataStreams are a part of the NTFS file systems, all files on a NTFS volume consist of at least
    one stream, the main stream, or the "data" stream. the full name of a stream is as follow:
    <filename>:<stream name>:<stream type>, the default data stream has no name, for example in a "test.txt"
    file, the stream will be "test.txt::$DATA". a user can create named streams in files, effectively 
    creating alternative data streams in the file. when opening a file the stream used is the default one,
    and the only way to read the content inside different streams is with a tool, like streams or echo.
    In the case of directories there is no default data stream, but there is a default directory stream,
    named "$I30" with type of "$INDEX_ALLOCATION". folder can also have data streams like files hooked to them.
