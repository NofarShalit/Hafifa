2) Ping Tunneling is the process of encapsulating data with ping packets, so that the packets can be dissasebled
    and release the data in the other computer. for example we can encapsulate RDP packets over ICMP and send the
    packets to a remote computer in order to dissaseble the packet and get a Remote Desktop,
    the other computer will think he is recieving ICMP packets while he actually recieves RDP packets
