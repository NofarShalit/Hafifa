2) ICMP Tunneling is a command and control attack technique that passes malicous trafic through normal looking
    ICMP echo requests and responses, Ping Tunneling is the process of encapsulating data with ICMP(Ping) packets,
    so that the packets can be dissasebled and release the malicious data in another computer. 
    Different types of data can be inserted into ICMP datagram like HTTP, TCP and SSH packets.
    A datagram is similarr to a packet but  it does not require an estalished connection or confirmation that the
    connection was recieved, ICMP Datagram include a data section that can include a pyaload of any size
    (but in reality mostly 1500 bytes at most for one packet becuase of MTU limitations). For example if an attacker
    wants to create a reverse shell, he can insert a SSH packet into the data section of the ICMP datagram packet
    that will establish the reverse shell, or a compromised device can send small pieces of data to an attacker
    through the datagram of an echo request.

    DNS Cache Poisining or DNS Spoofing is when an attacker is tricking a DNS resolver into caching wrong information
    with the expectation that the DNS resolver will send the wrong IP address to the clients, and the users will be
    directed to the wrong place, this attack is possible becuase DNS resolvers have no way to verify that the data in
    their caches is correct, so DNS information remains in the cache until the TTL expires or it is removed manually,
    DNSSEC is a protocol that aims to solves some of this problems.
    TL:DR - DNS Cache Poisining is the act of entering wrong inform ation into the DNS cache, so that DNS queries return
    an incorrect response and users will be redirected to the wrong website.
