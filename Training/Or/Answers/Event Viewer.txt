2) Secpol.msc is a windows module that lets us edit registry keys with a GUI, specifically registry keys and values
    related to security settings, the difference between Secpol.msc and Gpedit.msc is that Secpol.msc is a subsection of
    Gpedit.msc, and secpol focuses on local settings only while Gpedit focuses on an entire domain level of settings.
    GroupPolicies are stored in a hidden folder in "C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy"

3) EventID 4625: documents every failed attemp at logging in to a local computer, this event is generated form the same computer the user tried to logon interaction
    EventID 4821: a kerberos service ticket was denied becuase the suer, device or both does not meet the access control restrictions
    EventID 4822: NTLM authentication failed becuase the user account was a member of the protected users group
    The difference between all 3 of these EventId's is that event 4625 is generated when a user failes to login for hes fault, like entering the wrong
    password, EventId 4822 is generated when the user is protected or more accurate the user is in a protected group that doesn't allow it to connect,
    EventId 4821 is for when the user doesn't have enough permissions to connect and not becuase it is to important and protected to connect, like event 4822
    TL:DR - event 4625 is the users fault, event 4821 is the user lucking permissions to connect, event 4822 is the user being to 
    important to connect
