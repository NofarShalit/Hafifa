Event Viewer
1) The Win32LogonSession is a WMI class with 9 properties:
    Caption, Description, InstallDate, Name, Status, StartTime, AuthenticationPackage, LogonId and LogonType.
    The LogonType is the property that tells us what type of logon process happened, it can be an integer with type uint32,
    0 - used by the system account
    2 - Interactive, intended for users who are interractively using the machine like with remote shell
    3 - Network, Intended for servers to authenticate clear text passwords
    4 - Batch, Intended for batch servers where processess can be executed on behalf of the user without interaction
    5 - Service, Service type logon, the account provided must have service privelege enabled
    6 - Proxy, for proxy types logons
    7 - Unlock, This logon type is for GINA DLLs login on users, this logon type allows for a unique audit record
    to generate that shows the workstation has been unlocked
    8 - NetworkClearText, preserves the name and password in the authentication package, allowing the server to impersonate
    the clients and connect to other servers
    9 - NewCredentials, allows the caller to clone its current credentials, and login with the same local identity,
    and new credentials to other network clients and servers
    10 - RemoteInteractive, terminal services session that is both remote and interactive
    11 - CachedInteractive, attemp cached credentials without accessing the network
    12 - CachedRemoteInteractive, same as RemoteInteractive but for internal auditing
    13 - CachedUnlock, workstation logon

2) Secpol.msc is a windows module that lets us edit registry keys with a GUI, specifically registry keys and values
    related to security settings, the difference between Secpol.msc and Gpedit.msc is that Secpol.msc is a subsection of
    Gpedit.msc, and secpol focuses on local settings only while Gpedit focuses on an entire domain level of settings.
    GroupPolicies are stored in a hidden folder in "C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy"

3) EventID 4625: documents every failed attemp at logging in to a local computer, this event is generated form the same computer the user tried to logon interaction
    EventID 4821: a kerberos service ticket was denied becuase the suer, device or both does not meet the access control restrictions
    EventID 4822: NTLM authentication failed becuase the user account was a member of the protected users group
    The difference between all 3 of these EventId's is that event 4625 is generated when a user failes to login for hes fault, like entering the wrong
    password, EventId 4822 is generated when the user is protected or more accurate the user is in a protected group that doesn't allow it to connect,
    EventId 4821 is for when the user doesn't have enough permissions to connect and not becuase it is to important and protected to connect, like event 4822
    TL:DR - event 4625 is the users fault, event 4821 is the user lucking permissions to connect, event 4822 is the user being to 
    important to connect

4) Sysmon Events:
    - Process Create: EventID 1, logs creation of processes extensively, indexes full command that run, gives unique GUID across
    domain to make corelations easier, and saves full hash of the file
    Has the following fields:
    ProcessGUID, ProcessID, Image, FileVersion, Description, Product, Company, OriginalFileName, CommandLine, CurrentDirectory,
    User, LogonGUID, LogonID, TerminalSessionID, IntegrityLevel, Hashes, ParentProcessGUID, ParentProcessID, ParentImage, ParentCommandLine
    - Network Connection: EventID 3, the event logs TCP/UDP connections, logs ipv4 and ipv6 destination and source addresses and ports,
    and the ProcessGUID and ProcessID linked to the connection
    Has the following fields:
    RuleName, UtcTime, ProcessGUID, ProcessID, Image, User, Protocol, Initiated, SourceIsIpv6, SourceIP, SourceHostname, SourcePort,
    SourcePortName, DestinationIsIpv6, DestinationIP, DestinationHostname, DestinationPort, DestinationPortName
    Pipe Create: EventID 17, the event is created when a named pipe is created
    Has the following fields:
    RuleName, EventType, UtcTime, ProcessGUID, ProcessID, PipeName, Image
    - DNS Query: EventID 22, thew event is generated when a process executes a dns query
    Has the following fields:
    RuleName, UtcTime, ProcessGUID, ProcessID, QueryName, QueryStatus, QueryResults, Image
    - Create Remote Thread: EventID 8, created when a process creates a thread in a different process, indicates the source and target process,
    and includes information of the code to be run in the new thread like StartAddress, StartModule and StartFunction
    Has the following fields:
    RuleName, UtcTime, SourceProcessGUID, SourceProcessID, SourceImage, TargetProcessGUID, TargetProcessID, TargetImage, NewThreadID,
    StartAddress, StartModule, StartFunction
    Almost everything sysmon adds to event viewer did not exist beforehand, and for the few that did have much broader documentation and reporting
    for each event with sysmon
